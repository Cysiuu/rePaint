## About

This was my first project, so it's possible that there are bugs or non-optimal coding practices. While it served as a great learning experience for me, I recognize that there's room for improvement. I'm planning more projects in the future, where I'll apply what I've learned.

For now, this project is **not maintained**, but feel free to explore or use it if you find it helpful!
